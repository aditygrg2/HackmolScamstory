			<h1 class="py-2 font-sans">Investment scams are on the rise</h1>
			<p class="py-6">Preying on one of the most basic human flaws, investment scams and other get-rich-quick schemes are making up an ever larger portion of the online scammers’ cake. The number of victims, for now, is lower than the number of victims of fraudulent sales, identity fraud, and dating fraud, but the cost of investment fraud makes up almost half of all online fraud damages.

				And the scammers are very much aware that a large amount of money can be made, and they are more than willing to invest in the tools that make their fraud look more trustworthy. Last week, on the 26 January, 2022, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Bulgaria, supported by Europol and Eurojust, took down a network of online investment fraudsters. The scam was exposed after complaints were made by German and Greek investors who had lost all of the deposits they had invested in the online scam. The organized crime group responsible had set up websites and several call centers that appeared to be legitimate but were actually fraudulent. </p>


			
			<h1 class="py-2 font-sans">Recognizing investment scams</h1>
			<p class="py-6">We are by no means financial experts, but we have seen too many good people lose money on ponzi schemes, rug-pulls, and fake Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), so we feel it is our job to keep you safe, and warn against these types of online investment frauds.

				We realize that it is hard to tell investment scams apart from some of the more legitimate offers that are thrown at us in commercials every day. But we do want to hand you a few easy-to-follow rules to keep your money in your own hands:</p>

			<ol>
				<li class="py-3">If it sounds to good to be true, it usually isn’t true.</li>
				<li class="py-3">Very high return on investment rates, usually come with extremely high risks. Your money may sometimes even be better off in a casino.</li>
				<li class="py-3">When you are urged to act now, remember that while some legitimate opportunities want you to hurry scammers always want you to hurry.</li>
				<li class="py-3">If the return on investment is hardly better than what your financial advisor is offering you, is the difference really worth dealing with an unknown party?</li>
				<li class="py-3">Make sure to read the fine print. Understand what you are getting into.</li>
			</ol>

			
			<h1 class="py-2 font-sans">Types of investment fraud</h1>
			<p class="py-6">The FBI lists the following types of investment fraud:</p>

			<ol>
				<li class="py-3">Advance fee fraud. The victim pays money to someone in anticipation of receiving something of greater value and then receives little or nothing in return.</li>
				<li class="py-3">Ponzi schemes. Ponzi schemes promise high financial returns or dividends not available through traditional investments. Instead of investing the funds of victims, however, the con artist pays dividends to initial investors using the funds of subsequent investors. The scheme generally ends when the operator flees with all of the proceeds or when the funds for continued payment of dividends dry up.</li>
				<li class="py-3">Pyramid schemes. The difference with Ponzi schemes is that in pyramid schemes the victims themselves are induced to recruit further victims through the payment of recruitment commissions.</li>
				<li class="py-3">Market manipulation fraud, commonly referred to as “pump and dump” schemes, this fraud creates a temporary increase in the price of a targeted security (the pump), which is rapidly sold off by the initiating party into the inflated market by the fraudsters (the dump).</li>
				

			</ol>

			<h1 class="py-2 font-sans">When in doubt</h1>
			<p class="py-6">As indicated earlier, judging the trustworthiness of an offer by the looks of the website is not a good idea. Most scammers are really good at designing professional looking websites. One thing you can do is enter some determining factor of the website, a typical snippet, image or (fabricated) testimonials and throw them in your favorite search engine. If you can find other websites using the same content or run by the same owners, there is a good chance there are scammers at work that have run the same scheme before.

				Having a physical location you can turn to is not always conclusive, but it helps to know that you can turn to someone. It also helps if they are at least in the same country as you are. That makes it easier if lawsuits or other legal action needs to be taken.
				
				When dealing with larger sums of money there are bound to be contracts that protect both parties. Make sure to get a copy and study it before embarking. If you are not sure about the legal content, find someone who is an expert on these matters. That right there, is a good investment because it can save you a lot of money and trouble.</p>
