### Yes to Killing Scams

- Idea : Scamstory - No more Scamming
- Problem :


1.Internet scams are continually evolving. Consumers in India experienced a fairly high online fraud encounter rate of 69% in the past year. 31% Indians lost money through a scamâ€”the highest globally. There is a lack of scam knowledge and even the most intelligent and educated peeps fall prey to all these techniques.

2.Everyone of us has been a victim or observed a scam in front of us, right? (We are Indians, of course) and it makes all of us feel terrible about that mistake. And we really don't know, where to go, whom to ask for help!

3.A wide and declining communication gap between government and other help societies regarding scams in our country, makes us so huge winning, with scams !

-Solution:

1.As of now, there are so less resources and less awareness, and we aim to provide as much resources as possible in form of videos, blogs, offline events to make people undestand before they jump into another scam.

2.We through our website aims to focus on this bigger issue and help people become more aware of this problem, to help and to make them aware before they took a step in a new arena.
